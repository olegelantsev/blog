# What is used in the app?

FirebaseCrashlytics is used to collect crash analytics, collected data are not linked to the user ID. Application doesn’t ask for personal information. Game doesn’t use any backend servers apart from what 3rd-party framework FirebaseCrashlytics uses.

To be 100% transparent, here is what FirebaseCrashlytics says on the collected data:

## Always collected

- Collects stack traces and relevant application state when an application crashes.
- Collects device and OS information to assist with debugging crashes.

## Usage dependent

- Collects any custom keys, logs, and free-text user IDs that developers attach to crash - reports. Also collects any developer-defined non-fatal events with custom stack traces.
- Collects “breadcrumb” logs if Crashlytics is used together with Google Analytics. These logs - identify user actions immediately before a crash along with crash counts.
- Collects developer-defined portions of the Remote Config template and template metadata if the - Firebase Remote Config SDK is also included in the app. This data includes Remote Config - template version, rollout variant ID, parameter keys, and parameter values affected by active - rollouts.
