# Privacy Policy for Sudoku - Logic Trainer

**Effective Date:** December 26, 2025

At Sudoku - Logic Trainer, we believe that puzzles should be for your brain, not for your data. Your privacy is a priority, and this app is designed to be used without providing any personal information.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect any personal information that can identify you.

## 2. Anonymous Usage Data

To help us improve the game and provide a better experience, we collect limited, non-identifiable usage information. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to track you personally. This includes:

- **Session Duration:** How long the app is open
- **App Usage:** How many times the app is launched
- **Game Progress:** Which difficulty levels (Beginner to Expert) are being played

This data is typically provided to us through Apple App Analytics. This information is only shared with us if you have explicitly opted-in to share "Share with App Developers" in your iOS device settings.

## 3. Data Storage

Sudoku - Logic Trainer stores your game progress (such as current board state and best times) locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to any external servers.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party tracking SDKs, advertising networks, or data brokers.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our app is safe for all ages. Because we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly or unknowingly collect data from children.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."

## 7. Contact Us
